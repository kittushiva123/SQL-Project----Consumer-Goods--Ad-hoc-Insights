Some of the important learnings from this project are:

1. Applying many important SQL concepts like Subqueries, Multiple joins, CTE, Window functions, etc. to query the database for a meaningful business scenario.

2. Using a custom visual called "dumbbell chart" in Power BI, to visualize the difference between any two variables effectively. Thanks to Yuki Kakegawa for sharing about dumbbell chart.

3. Exploring various features in PowerPoint to make the presentation effective.

Thanks to Dhaval Patel and Hemanand Vadivel for bringing out such nice projects having meaningful business scenarios. Also thanks to NAVEEN S for clearing some of my doubts while I was working on the SQL queries. Also if you are interested about story telling with data, check out Brent Dykes's profile, I have personally applied a lot of principles which I have learned through his Linked in posts.
