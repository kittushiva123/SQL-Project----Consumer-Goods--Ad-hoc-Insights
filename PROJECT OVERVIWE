1. SQL - I have used SQL to query the database. Applied many important concepts in SQL like Subqueries, Multiple joins, CTE, Window functions, etc.

2. Power BI - Visualized the extracted data using Power BI. Used different visuals like Bar Chart, Dumbbell Chart, Line Chart, Donut Chart etc. to clearly communicate the insights from the data.
